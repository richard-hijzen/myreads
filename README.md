# MyReads Project

This is the my-reads react app. It's a simple app where you can show the status of what books you are reading.
There are 3 directories. Currently reading, want to read and read. You can switch the book directory by clicking on the green button on top of the book and selecting a directory. If you want to add a new book you can click on the green button in the right corner on the bottom with the + sign. It'll guide you to a new page where you can search books. Also there you can add books to directories by clicking the green button on the book.

## starting up

To get started developing right away:

* Download or clone this repository from github.
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
